//! # uqoin-core
//! 
//! **uqoin-core** is the foundational library for the Uqoin cryptocurrency   
//! protocol. It provides all essential components for managing coins, 
//! transactions, blocks, and blockchain state in a secure, efficient, and
//! deterministic way.
//! 
//! ---
//! 
//! ## Features
//! 
//! - **Elliptic Curve Cryptography** (Ed25519 signatures and key operations)
//! - **Deterministic Key Generation** (BIP-39 style mnemonic seeds)
//! - **Coin Structure and Mining** (unique order-based mining validation)
//! - **Transaction System** (transfer, fee, split, and merge types)
//! - **Block Management** (validation, linking, and complexity proofs)
//! - **State Management** (dynamic tracking of coin ownership and counters)
//! - **Asynchronous Storage** (disk-based persistence with `Lbasedb`)
//! - **Transaction Pool** (preparation of transactions for new blocks)

//! | `transaction`  | Transaction types and verification         |
//! | `block`        | Block structure and hash validation        |
//! | `state`        | Real-time blockchain state management      |
//! | `pool`         | Transaction pooling before block creation |
//! | `seed`         | Mnemonic generation and deterministic keys |
//! | `blockchain`   | Persistent blockchain storage              |

//! 
//! ## Philosophy
//! 
//! - **Minimalistic** and protocol-focused design
//! - **Deterministic** and reproducible operations
//! - **High-performance** and scalable storage
//! - **Secure** cryptographic foundations
